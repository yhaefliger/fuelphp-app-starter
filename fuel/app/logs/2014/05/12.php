ERROR - 2014-05-12 11:57:16 --> Error - date_default_timezone_get(): It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings. You are *required* to use the date.timezone setting or the date_default_timezone_set() function. In case you used any of those methods and you are still getting this warning, you most likely misspelled the timezone identifier. We selected 'Europe/Paris' for '2.0/DST' instead in C:\UwAmp\www\OTHER\fstart\fuel\core\classes\fuel.php on line 161
